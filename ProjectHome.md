<br><b>DCrypt</b>
<br>Dcrypt is an encryption (and decryption) utility which uses a different, special way of encrypting as the other encryption utilities<br>
<br>Depending on which password you use, a different pattern will be used.<br>
<br>Dcrypt has a system in which encryption methods are linked to a letter of the alphabet.<br>
<br>If you choose your pass, every single character will be processed, every letter will call an encryption method, every number will be used as an extra argument for the encryption methods and other characters are used for other thins.<br>
<br>
<br>Example: password=xqr7ad(17)<br>
this will first use the x-encryption method on your text, then the q-encryption method and then the r-encryption method with extra argument 7, then the a-encryption method will be used and as last the d-encryptin method with as argument 17<br>
<br>
<br>As you can see the () are used to hold arguments longer as one char.<br>
